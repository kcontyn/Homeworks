        <h1>ACT 1</h1>
        <h1>PROLOGUE</h1>
            <p>Two households, both alike in dignity,</p>
            <p>In fair Verona, where we lay our scene,</p>
            <p>From ancient grudge break to new mutiny,</p>
            <p>Where civil blood makes civil hands unclean.</p>
            <p>From forth the fatal loins of these two foes</p>
            <p>A pair of star-cross'd lovers take their life;</p>
            <p>Whose misadventures piteous overthrows</p>
            <p>Do with their death bury their parents' strife.</p>
            <p>The fearful passage of their death-mark'd love,</p>
            <p>And the continuance of their parents' rage,</p>
            <p>Which, but their children's end, nought could remove,</p>
            <p>Is now the two hours' traffic of our stage;</p>
            <p>The which if you with patient ears attend,</p>
            <p>What here shall miss, our toil shall strive to mend.</p>

            <h1>SCENE I. Verona. A public place</h1>
            <p>Enter SAMPSON and GREGORY, of the house of Capulet, armed with swords and bucklers</p>
            <h1>SAMPSON</h1>
            <p>Gregory, o' my word, we'll not carry coals.</p>
            <h1>GREGORY</h1>
            <p>No, for then we should be colliers.</p>
